- Hi! My name is Rachel. I am a full-stack web developer with 2 years of academic experience.
- My skills include HTML and CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Java, and C#. I also have experience with database design!
- I use Visual Studio Code for all of my HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP needs. I tend to prefer NetBeans and Scene Builder for Java, and of course, Visual Studio Community for C#. Additionally, I use XAMPP for my server stack during web app development.
- My interested outside software/web design include photography, mycology, reading fiction, and playing video games. I love spooky books and games.
- I'm open to collaborate on projects with others. I'm interested in anything that will push me to the limits of my current abilities and help me learn new skills.
